🎯 Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning - A Step Towards Better Health Insights 🩺

🔍 What’s the project about? I’ve developed an interactive Diabetes Prediction Web App using machine learning, designed to help identify individuals at risk for diabetes. This tool leverages various classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions based on user data.

💻 How does it work?

1.Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed in-depth analysis to understand patterns and relationships within the data.
3.Model Training: I tested several algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, and found Random Forest to give the highest accuracy at 74%.
4.Deployment: I created an easy-to-use Flask web app, where users can simply enter their data and receive predictions instantly.
5.Hosting: I deployed the app on AWS Free Tier for global accessibility. I used PuTTY and WinSCP for seamless access and management of the server, ensuring smooth hosting of the app.

🌐 Accessible Anywhere Thanks to AWS, the app is available worldwide. Users can interact with it, get real-time predictions, and learn about their diabetes risk from any device with internet access.

💡 Why is it important? This web app is designed to raise awareness and assist in early detection of diabetes, contributing to better health management.
