# Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning - A Step Towards Better Health Insights 🩺

🔍 **What’s the project about?**  
I’ve developed an interactive **Diabetes Prediction Web App** using machine learning, designed to help identify individuals at risk for diabetes. This tool leverages various classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions based on user data.

💻 **How does it work?**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers etc.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed in-depth analysis to understand patterns and relationships within the data.
3. **Model Training**: Tested several algorithms, including **Random Forest Classifier**, **KNN**, **SVM**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Tree**, and found **Random Forest** to give the highest accuracy at **74%**.
4. **Deployment**: Created an easy-to-use **Flask web app**, where users can simply enter their data and receive predictions instantly.
5. **Hosting**: Deployed the app on **AWS Free Tier** for global accessibility. I used **PuTTY** and **WinSCP** for seamless access and management of the server, ensuring smooth hosting of the app.

🌐 **Accessible Anywhere**  
Thanks to AWS, the app is available worldwide. Users can interact with it, get real-time predictions, and learn about their diabetes risk from any device with internet access.

💡 **Why is it important?**  
This web app is designed to raise awareness and assist in early detection of diabetes, contributing to better health management.
